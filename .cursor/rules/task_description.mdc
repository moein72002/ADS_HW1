# Data Analysis & Engineering Project

## 1. Exploratory Analysis and Data Cleaning
On the dataset of your choice, perform:
* **Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with meaningful insights.
* **Data cleaning:** Handling missing, invalid, or duplicate values.
* **Preprocessing:** Converting all features to numerical values.
* **Normalization or standardization.**
* Clear explanations and overall notebook readability.

## 2. Data Visualization
* Practice different visualization techniques using your dataset.
* Choose appropriate plot types based on your analysis goals.
* **Include:**
    * Pie charts and box plots
    * Line charts and multi-line charts
    * Bar charts, grouped and stacked bar charts
    * Scatter plots and bubble charts
    * Charts showing uncertainty (error bars)
    * Interactive charts using **Plotly** or **Bokeh**
* **Each chart must have:**
    * Proper title
    * Axis labels and ranges
    * Legends

## 3. Feature Engineering
Using your chosen dataset:
* **Create new features based on:**
    * Ratios, binning, mathematical functions, and feature combinations
    * Date/time transformations
    * Counts or aggregation statistics
* Perform feature selection using **Mutual Information**.
* Apply dimensionality reduction using **PCA**.
* Provide clear explanations and a readable notebook.
* **Answer the following reflective question (in English or Persian):**
    > “When is feature engineering a nice-to-have option, and when is it a must-have?”

## 4. Web Scraping (Bonus)
* Write a simple scraper to extract data for **50 “Samand” cars** manufactured **after 1385** from **bama.ir**.
* **Extract the following fields:**
    * Price
    * Mileage
    * Color
    * Production year
    * Transmission type (manual/automatic)
    * Description
* **Submit:**
    * Your scraper code
    * The collected data in an Excel (`.xlsx`) file
